👋 Hi, I’m @sshguerrilla  
👀 I’m interested in AI-powered cybersecurity, offensive security research, and cryptographic protocol improvements.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in adversarial AI, vulnerability detection, and symbolic execution.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving AI-driven security, secure distributed systems, and real-world vulnerability analysis.  
⚡ Fun fact: I once lived in Poland for a year and Mexico for four years, gaining a global perspective on security threats and solutions.
